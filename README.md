# Bharat Intern - Machine Learning Internship

This repository contains the projects completed during my Machine Learning internship at Bharat Intern. The main objective of these tasks was to build predictive models using various datasets.



## 🚀 Projects Overview

### 1. House Price Prediction
**File:** `task1/TASK-1.ipynb`

A machine learning model designed to predict the price of a house based on various features.

* **Dataset:** `Housing.csv`
* **Key Features:**
    * Area, Number of Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Stories
    * Amenities (Main road access, Guestroom, Basement, etc.)
    * Furnishing Status
* **Workflow:**
    * Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
    * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pairplots and correlation heatmaps
    * Model Training & Price Prediction

### 2. Wine Quality Prediction
**File:** `task2/TASK 2.ipynb`

A predictive system built to estimate the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties.

* **Dataset:** `WineQuality.csv`
* **Key Features:**
    * Acidity (Fixed, Volatile, Citric)
    * Sugar, Chlorides, Sulfur Dioxide levels
    * Density, pH, Sulphates, Alcohol content
* **Workflow:**
    * Data loading and statistical summary
    * Feature visualization
    * Quality Classification/Prediction

### Task 3: Wine Quality Analysis
* **Description:** A continuation or variation of the wine quality analysis project.
* **File:** `task3/TASK 2.ipynb`
* **Dataset:** `WineQuality.csv`
