# Bharat Intern Machine Learning Internship

This repository contains the source code for the Machine Learning tasks completed during the Bharat Intern internship.

## Projects

### Task 1: House Price Prediction
* **Description:** A machine learning model to analyze and predict house prices based on various property features.
* **Dataset:** `Housing.csv`
* **Key Features:** Price, Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Stories, Amenities (Mainroad, Guestroom, Basement, etc.), Furnishing Status.
* **Goal:** To predict the price of a house using the given features.

### Task 2: Wine Quality Prediction
* **Description:** A project to assess and predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical tests.
* **Dataset:** `WineQuality.csv`
* **Key Features:** Fixed/Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid, Residual Sugar, Chlorides, Sulfur Dioxide levels, Density, pH, Sulphates, Alcohol.
* **Target:** `quality` (score between 0 and 10).

### Task 3: Iris Flowers Classification
* **Description:** A classification model to identify the species of Iris flowers based on the dimensions of their sepals and petals.
* **Dataset:** `Iris.csv`
* **Algorithm:** Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with a linear kernel.
* **Key Features:** Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width.
* **Target:** `Species` (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica).
* **Performance:** Achieved an accuracy of approximately 97%.

## Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * Pandas (Data Manipulation)
    * NumPy (Numerical Operations)
